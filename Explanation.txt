Step 1. For every block check if it satisfy all reqs,
	If it satisfy than push 0 distance into another array,
	like if for block 0 : {"gym": true, "school":true, "store":true}
	push 0 one by one in list2. At the end list2 will be [0,0,0]
	
	If any reqs for current block is false then move to step 2
	
Step 2. As the current block don't satisfy all reqs so we need to check other 
	blocks which satisfy remaining reqs. Here we need to find the block 
	which satisfy any of remiaing reqs and have the smallest distance from 
	current block (the one we are trying to find reqs for)
	If found any block then push it's index or distance from the host block
	into the list2 
	
	when we satisfied all the requirements for one block and find the
	distances of nearest block which satisfy remaining reqs then move to
	step 3 
	
Step 3. Push list2 array into list1 (which is empty in the beginning) when one 
	reqs are satisfied ,
	
*** Keep repeating Step 1-3 for all other blocks, when finished then list1
    array will look like something this [[1,0,4],[0,1,4],[0,0,2],[1,0,1],
    [2,0,0]] depend upon number of blocks and reqs. Now move to Step 4

Step 4. Now for all the items inside list1 (which are arrays) find individual
	item sum and push into list3 array.
	We will use this sum for finding the block with nearest distances.
	-> list3 will look like something this: [5, 5, 2, 2, 2] 
	Move to Step 5
	
Step 5. Now we will find the min sum from list3. We will also check if sum of 
	other elements is also equal to min sum. If so then push all of their 
	respective index according to list3 into indexes array.
	Move to Step 6
	
Step 6. 1. If our indexes array contains only one item it means there is only
	   one block which have the samllest sum. 
	   Return the index of this block
	2. Else If there are more than one block which have equal min sum than 
	   we will find out which of them have shortest distance to all reqs.
	   
	   There are many ways to do this but for our solution we implemented
	   like this ->
	   
	   For all the index in indexes array sort items of list1 and remove 
	   duplicates (only in the item) and save them in variable a.
	   'a' will look like this : [[0,2],[0,1],[0,2]]
	   
	   Convert items in a into string and push that string into list4
	   list4 will look like this -> ['02','01','02']
	   
	   Move to Step 7.
	   
Step 7. Now find the smallest items from list4 and find it's index. Use this 
	index to retrieve the index from indexes array. Which will gave the 
	index of block with all reqs with shortest distances.
	
	Note: list4 will return the first index if there more then one block
	      with same minimum distance.
	
	return this index.
	
	That's it!!!
	
	

There are many ways we can solve this problem and also optimize this solution.
This solution is checked only for a certain block array and reqs array, but i hope it will work for other block and reqs arrays.
